|service-fullname| provides an easy way for you to view and manage your
billing data. You can examine data at the organization or project
level.

{+service+} Features and Best Practices for Billing Data
--------------------------------------------------------

Billing Quota Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| offers real-time notifications when spending nears or exceeds
set thresholds. You can customize these alerts to be project-specific or
team-specific, allowing for precise monitoring and control over
different areas of cloud expenditure. To configure billing alerts, see
:ref:`configure-alerts`.

Resource Tagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| uses resource tagging for precise cost allocation by
categorizing resources according to departments, projects, or cost
centers. You can also group and analyze tagged resources in financial
reports, providing a clear and organized view of how various teams or
projects contribute to overall cloud spending. To learn more, see
:ref:`configure-resource-tags`.

Cross-Organization Billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| allows you to share a billing subscription across many
organizations and to pay a single invoice for them. 

After you configure a paying organization, you pay invoices for the paying
organization that include a list of charges incurred for all linked
organizations. To learn more, see :ref:`cross-org-billing`.

Monthly Cost Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view your billing data monthly, navigate to the :guilabel:`Cost
Explorer` page. The Cost Explorer provides a granular view of cloud
spending in chart and table form, allowing users to analyze costs by
{+clusters+}, projects, or teams. Historical spending data and
customizable filters help identify trends and inefficiencies, enabling
better financial decision-making and resource optimization. You can view
your usage over the past six months, and access your billing data up to
the past 18 months.

The Billing Cost Explorer filters and groups usage data by organization,
project, {+cluster+}, and service. Each filter contains a :guilabel:`Usage`
chart with stacked columns representing the total cost incurred each
month. Underneath, there is a :guilabel:`Usage By Month` table that
displays the billing data shown in the chart. To learn more, see
:ref:`cost-explorer`.

Annual Cost Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view your billing data annually, navigate to the :guilabel:`Billing
Overview` page. This page helps you to understand the costs incurred by
your organization's {+service+} usage by service, deployment, and
project. Each category contains a :guilabel:`Usage` chart with stacked
columns representing the total cost incurred each month. To learm more,
see :ref:`Year-to-Date Usage Chart <billing-visualizations>`.

Invoice Cost Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view your billing data as an invoice, click on the
:guilabel:`Invoice Date` or :guilabel:`Invoice Period` you want to
view. This page shows you the costs incurred by your {+service+} usage
over the invoice period through the :guilabel:`Total Usage` and
:guilabel:`By Deployment` charts.

For the  :guilabel:`Total Usage` chart, you can filter your usage by
service to view charges incurred by a particular {+service+} service.
For the :guilabel:`By Deployment` chart, you can view the proportion of
your usage incurred by each of your {+clusters+} and serverless instances
across all your projects.

To view line-item charges, see :ref:`view-past-invoices`.
